# Auto-generated README (Round 1)

**Project brief:** Publish a single-page site that fetches data.csv from attachments, sums its sales column, sets the title to 'Sales Summary ${seed}', displays the total inside #total-sales, and loads Bootstrap 5 from jsdelivr.

**Attachments:**
- data.csv (text/csv): (could not read preview: )

**Checks to meet:**
js: document.title === 'Sales Summary ${seed}'\njs: cleardocument.querySelector("link[href*='bootstrap']")\njs: Math.abs(parseFloat(document.querySelector('#total-sales').textContent) - ${result}) < 0.01

## Setup
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. No build steps required.

## Notes
This README was generated as a fallback (OpenAI did not return an explicit README).
